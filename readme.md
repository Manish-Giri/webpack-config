# Webpack

If you've ever found Webpack annoying/confusing/**insert-word-here** difficult to setup, this repository can help!

### What is it?

This contains the most essential features required for bundling up all your files in any medium-big project. I've ***mostly*** used the latest versions of the dependencies(loaders/libraries) involved, so it should be good to go at any point in the future! As of writing this, the webpack version used here is `3.2.0`.

### How do I use it?

Fork it, clone it, or download as a zip, and read the things in it. [Get in touch with me](https://twitter.com/1_infinite_loop) if you've got questions!
